              At StateCraft, we're dedicated to making the Theory of Computation more accessible, engaging, and easier to grasp for students of all levels. Our mission is to empower learners with innovative tools and interactive visualizations that breathe life into complex topics like finite automata and regular expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
              By bridging the gap between abstract concepts and practical understanding, we help students engage with the material intuitively, providing them with the confidence and clarity to master these challenging areas of computer science.

          <AboutSection icon={History} title="Our Journey">
            <p>
              StateCraft was born from the idea that traditional methods of teaching computational theory—through text and equations alone—aren’t enough for today’s learners. Founded by a team of educators and developers, we set out to create a more dynamic learning experience, combining animations and simulations to make these difficult concepts easier to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a small project quickly grew into a comprehensive educational platform used by thousands of students globally. Today, StateCraft helps learners visualize and interact with the building blocks of computation, making difficult theories more accessible than ever.

          <AboutSection icon={Users} title="Why StateCraft">
            <p>
              StateCraft brings Theory of Computation concepts to life through engaging animations and interactive simulations. Our platform helps students better understand finite automata, regular expressions, and more by letting them visualize these concepts in real-time, fostering a deeper and more intuitive understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              We prioritize accuracy in all our simulations, ensuring that the visualizations and interactions are reliable and grounded in solid theory. Our goal is to create an experience that’s as educational as it is enjoyable, with intuitive UI/UX design that makes the platform easy to use for students of all levels.
